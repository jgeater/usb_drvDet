usb_drvDet 1.0
Written by jgeau in c# requires .net 3.0 or higher

usb_drvDet.exe is just a simple tool that displays a dialog box asking the user to remove the USB drive if one is found on the machine.

The message box is always on top so the user cannt send it behind other apps.

It doesn not require admin rights
